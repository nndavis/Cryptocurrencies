# Cryptocurrencies
 
## Overview
The base of this challenge is unsupervised machine learning. The dataset is based around cryptocurrency. The client wants to know which coins to add to an investment portfolio. By the end there will be a plot to show total coin supply vs total coins mined. In this challenge I showed how to process data, clustering using K-means, reduce dimensions, and reduce principal components by using PCA. I also use holoviz plots to visualize the data as well as scatter_3D.
